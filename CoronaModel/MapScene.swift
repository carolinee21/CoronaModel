     @JJ: This method is pretty weird lol basically there's no good way
     to repeatedly generate new random movement for each Sprite while
     still allowing it to function in the background. So basically, for
     each node, I made a sequence of random events that it does on a loop
     forever. It essentially does three random moves, then reverses those moves
     in the original order (i.e. first follows vectors A, B, C, then -A, -B, -C).
     Feel free to play around with it - I just thought this semi-randomness
     was enough to represent random movement visually
