     @JJ: This method is pretty weird lol basically there's no good way
     to repeatedly generate new random movement for each Sprite while
     still allowing it to function in the background. So basically, for
     each node, I made a sequence of random events that it does on a loop
     forever. It essentially does three random moves, then reverses those moves
     in the original order (i.e. first follows vectors A, B, C, then -A, -B, -C).
     Feel free to play around with it - I just thought this semi-randomness
     was enough to represent random movement visually

        This function is a sort of listener for contacts between cases.
        Right now it is configured using SKPhysics things for each sprite so
        that only "case" nodes will contact each other.
     
     @Caroline: I want to keep track of R0, the amount of people a single person
     infects. It's supposedly like the most telling stat for infectious diseases.
     Anyway the function updateRO() just iterates through the nodes and computes the
     R0 by summing up, for each node, how many people that node infected and then
     dividing out by the number of total nodes. I ended up dividing out the number
     of totalNodes by 2, I think it's just harder to map b/c we have a very finite amount
     of nodes in our simulation.
     
     Ideally we'd compute R0 once, after the simulation is over. But
     since we're not yet sure abt when the simulation will "finish" I just
     put it in this func and it computes a bunch of times as it goes.
     
     Not sure a more efficient way to do this rn.
